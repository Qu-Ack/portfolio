# My Development Setup in 2026

After years of tweaking, I've landed on a setup that just works. Here's what I use.

## Editor: VS Code

Still the best balance of speed and features.

### Key Extensions

1. **GitHub Copilot** - AI pair programming
2. **Error Lens** - Inline error messages
3. **Thunder Client** - API testing
4. **GitLens** - Git supercharged

### Settings

```json
{
  "editor.fontSize": 14,
  "editor.fontFamily": "JetBrains Mono",
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.minimap.enabled": false
}
```

## Terminal: Ghostty

Fast, simple, and stays out of my way.

- GPU accelerated
- True color support
- Splits and tabs

## Shell: Fish

User-friendly and feature-rich out of the box.

- Autosuggestions
- Web-based config
- Amazing tab completion

## Tools

- **Git** - Version control
- **Docker** - Containerization  
- **fnm** - Node version management
- **ripgrep** - Fast search

## Hardware

- MacBook Pro M3 Max
- 32GB RAM
- 1TB SSD
- 27" 4K monitor

## Philosophy

> The best setup is the one you stop thinking about.

Don't over-engineer. Find what works and stick with it.

## Conclusion

Your tools should help you focus on the problem, not the tools themselves. Keep it simple.
